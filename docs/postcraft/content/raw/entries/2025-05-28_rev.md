I would like you to update the Ragno ontology with details as below. Think deeply and look for intersections with the skos and prov-o ontologies and use of OWL and other common vocabulary terms that may be added as statements. Render the revised version as four artifacts : a short overview README.md, a detailed namespace document description, the ontology in RDF Turtle and a mermaid class diagram

* Ragno is a SKOS scheme for describing knowledgebases

* remove ragno:isRetrievable
* remove Query
* remove Document
* remove CoreElement
* add ragno:Corpuscle
* add ragno:IndexElement
* add ragno:subType with domain ragno:Element, range skos:Concept

A ragno:Corpus is a body of knowledge, a skos:Collection of ragno:Element instances
A ragno:Corpuscle is a conceptual subset of a ragno:Corpus represented as a skos:Collection of ragno:Element instances

Examples of ragno:IndexElement include a vector store style embedding or a set of keywords.

Remove references to Named Graph Architecture.
```

Make the following adjustments and revise all four artifacts accordingly:
remove ragno:Embedding
replace creator reference with "Danny Ayers" foaf:homepage https://danny.ayers.name
add DOAP vocabulary terms for the Ragno ontology - the repo is at http://github.com/danja/ragno
Arrange the diagram so that Elements are in a grouping, as are (Corpus, Corpuscle, Community) and (Entity, Relationship, Unit, Attribute)
