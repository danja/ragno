The Ragno ontology (Italian for "spider") is used to describe a knowledgebase. The information model is largely derived from the paper NodeRAG which is in Project knowledge along with a first pass at the ontology and associated material. The Provo and SKOS ontologies are also attached, we should draw on these wherever appropriate.

The ragno: namespace is http://purl.org/stuff/ragno/

I wish to make a few changes to the terminology (Table 6 in the paper) for clarity :
* additional term `ragno:Element` (subclass of `skos:Concept`)
* "Text" -> `ragno:TextElement` (with `ragno:content` property pointing to the text literal)
* "Semantic Unit" -> `ragno:Unit` (subclass of `ragno:Element`)
* "High-Level Element" -> `ragno:CommunityElement` (subclass of `ragno:Element`)
* "High-Level Overview" -> `skos:CoreElement` (subclass of `ragno:Element`)

Think how to do this in a structured fashion following best practices. Please refactor the documents and diagrams accordingly and render the results as complete, individual artifacts.
